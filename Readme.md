## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

----


## Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook. You can install Python from the official Python website and Jupyter Notebook can be installed using the following command:


```python
pip install jupyter
```

----


## Installation
To get started, simply clone the repository:

```python
git clone https://github.com/MonitSharma/Numerical-Linear-Algebra.git
```

-----


## Usage
You will find the content organized into directories according to the topics covered in this repository. The examples and exercises are provided in Jupyter notebooks that can be run on your local machine. To run the Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and type the following command in the terminal:

```python
jupyter notebook
```

This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a web page in your browser. Click on the notebook you want to open and start exploring the content.
